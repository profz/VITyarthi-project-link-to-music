# Project Statement

**Conversion of youtube Links to desired audio format as per the user's needs** 

# Scope of the Project 

* **The project will include features to select multiple formats from mp3,flac, wav, with varying quality as well**

* **The only limiting factor of the project will include the availabilty of the video to be downloaded and certain copyrights issues relative to the owner of the the original video**

* **Since the project is exclusively aimed to download audio, using yt-dlp, it can also fetch the metadata of the video. This might give into added time to download and take up space, which is comparably negligible**


# Target Users

* **Target users include majorly students who wish to personalize their music offline without the need to get into a browser(excluding the need to copy links) and end up doomscrolling**

* **This also eliminates the need to be online and have network connectivity, and not relying on streaming platforms which mostly blasts ads**


# High Level Feature

* **with the added inclusion of fzf and youtube api integration, the tool could very well be it's own cli based music searcher and downloader***

*  **This feature might elevate the overall experience and eliminate the afore mentioned dependency on browsers and youtube to search and copy link**
